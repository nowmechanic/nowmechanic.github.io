GlideAJAX Equivalent for Service Portal – Getting Server Data from Client


<p>In the Service Portal, the scripting environment is different from the ServiceNow backend.</p>
 <p>Portal widgets utilize AngularJS, which introduces a model-view-controller approach to passing data 
 and handling what is presented to the end user. Sometimes it is necessary, like on the backend, 
 to access server-side data from arbitrary records in response to form behavior, button clicks,
 or other client-side triggers. One way to do this without requiring a page reload is to use the “get” function.</p>
